## USC-EE569 Spring 2021

As one can guess, this is a repo where I will store all of the homework assignments for this course
(EE-569 Digital Image Processing).

The file structure should be relatively easy to follow and I have a README for each homework assignment that gives a general idea of how the folder itself is structured and how to run the code.

The general breakdown of each assignment is as follows:
### Homework 1
**Problem 1: Image Demosaicing and Histogram Manipulation** <br>
   a) Bilinear Demosaicing
   a) Histogram Manipulation

**Problem 2: Image Denoising**
   a) Basic Denoising Methods
