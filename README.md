## USC-EE569 Spring 2021

As one can guess, this is a repo where I will store all of the homework assignments for this course
(EE-569 Digital Image Processing).

The file structure should be relatively easy to follow and I have a README for each homework assignment that gives a general idea of how the folder itself is structured and how to run the code.

The general breakdown of each assignment is as follows:
### Homework 1
**Problem 1: Image Demosaicing and Histogram Manipulation**
   1. Bilinear Demosaicing
   2. Histogram Manipulation

**Problem 2: Image Denoising**
   1. Basic Denoising Methods
   2. Bilateral Filtering
   3. Non-Local Means (NLM) Filtering
   4. Mixed noises in color image

**Problem 3: Special Effect Image Filters: Creating Oil Painting Effect**

### Homework 2
**Problem 1: Edge Detection**
1. Sobel Edge Detector
2. Canny Edge Detector
3. Structured Edge
4. Performance Evaluation

**Problem 2: Digital Half-toning**
1. Dithering
2. Error Diffusion

**Problem 3: Color Half-toning with Error Diffusion**

### Homework 3
**Problem 1: Geometric Image Modification** <br>

**Problem 2: Homographic Transformation and Image Stitching**

**Problem 3: Morphological Processing**
1. Basic morphological process implementation
2. Solution to the maze
3. Defect detection and count

### Homework 4
**Problem 1: Texture Analysis**
1. Texture Classification - Feature Extraction

**Problem 2: Texture Segmentation**
1. Basic Texture Segmentation
2. Advanced Texture Segmentation

**Problem 3: SIFT and Image Matching**
1. Saliet Point Descriptor
2. Image Matching
3. Bag of Words

### Homework 5
**Problem 1: CNN Training on LeNet-5**
1. CNN Architecture
2. Compare classification performance on different datasets
3. Apply traed network to negative images

### Homework 6
**Problem 1: Origin of Green Learning**
1. Feedforward-designed Convolutional Neural Networks (FF-CNNs)
2. PxelHop and PixelHop++

**Problem 2: MNIST & Fashion-MNIST Classification**
