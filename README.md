## USC-EE569 Spring 2021

As one can guess, this is a repo where I will store all of the homework assignments for this course
(EE-569 Digital Image Processing).

<br>
The file structure should be relatively easy to follow and I have a README for each homework assignment that gives a general idea of how the folder itself is structured and how to run the code.

<br>
The general breakdown of each assignment is as follows:
### Homework 1
*Problem 1: Image Demosaicing and Histogram Manipulation*
   (a) Bilinear Demosaicing
   (b) Histogram Manipulation
<br> 
*Problem 2: Image Denoising*
   (a) Basic Denoising Methods
   (b) Bilateral Filtering

   (d) Mixed noises in color image
<br>
