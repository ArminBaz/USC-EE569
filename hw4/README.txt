### Student Information
Name: Armin Bazarjani
Class: EE-569 Introduction to Digital Image Processing
Date: March 28th, 2021
Assignment: Homework 4


### Tech Information
I am running everything on MacOS (Catalina Version 10.15.7).
I am compiling all cpp files using g++. (g++ -dumpversion returns 12.0.0).
I am using MATLAB_R20b for the .m files.


### File Structure
homework 1
         |
         |> Problem 1
         |          |> 1a (main files: problem_1a.m)
         |          |> 1b (main files: problem_1b.m)
         |
         |> Problem 2
         |          |> 2a (main file: problem_2a.m)
         |          |> 2b (main file: problem_2b.m)
         |
         |> Problem 3 (main file: problem_3.cpp)
         |          |> 3b (main file: problem_3b.m)
         |          |> 3c (main file: problem_3c.m)


### How to Run
All of the problems should be self-contained as they are all MATLAB scripts. The only thing the grader
should change are the defined paths to the images for each question.
